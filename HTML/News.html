           <h4>WHY HAS RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE?</h4>
            <div class="newsImage">
                <p>
                    Russia invaded Ukraine, which is a neighboring country of Russia. Russia's plan to invade Ukraine was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin via television on February 24, 2022. The Russian leader's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government, ending for good its desire to join the Western defensive alliance Nato. After a month of failures, he abandoned his bid to capture the capital Kyiv and turned his ambitions to Ukraine's east and south. Ukraine's democratically elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said "the enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two". His adviser said Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound.
                    <br> <br>
                    Russia's leader refused to call it an invasion or a war. Moscow continues to coin Europe's biggest war since 1945 a "special military operation". The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine are completely unfounded but part of a narrative repeated by Russia for years. "It's crazy, sometimes not even they can explain what they are referring to" complained Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.

           <h4>WHAT'S PUTIN'S PROBLEM WITH NATO?</h4>
           <div class="newsImage">
               <p>
                   For Russia's leader the West's 30-member defensive military alliance has one aim - to split society in Russia and ultimately destroy it. In a Victory Day speech on 9 May he accused Nato of launching an active military build-up on territories adjacent to Russia.
                   <br> <br>
                   Ahead of the war, he demanded that Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and reverse its eastward expansion, removing its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997 and not deploying "strike weapons near Russia's borders". That means Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.

           <h4>HOW PUTIN SEES UKRAINE?</h4>
           <p>
                Since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, as the Soviet Union collapsed, it has gradually looked to the West - both the EU and Nato. Russia's leader has sought to reverse that, seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the "disintegration of historical Russia". He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people, denying Ukraine its long history and seeing today's independent state merely as an "anti-Russia project". "Ukraine never had stable traditions of genuine statehood," he asserted.
                <br> <br>
                It was his pressure on Ukraine's pro-Russian leader, Viktor Yanukovych, not to sign a deal with the European Union in 2013 that led to protests that ultimately ousted the Ukrainian president in February 2014. Russia then seized Ukraine's southern region of Crimea and triggered a separatist rebellion in the east and a war that claimed 14,000 lives.
                <br> <br>
                As he prepared to invade in February, he tore up an unfulfilled 2015 Minsk peace deal and accused Nato of threatening "our historic future as a nation", claiming without foundation that Nato countries wanted to bring war to Crimea. He has lately accused Nato of using Ukraine to wage a proxy war against Russia.

            <h4>THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE</h4>
            <div class="newsImage">
                <p>
                    The effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine are starting to be felt, with European gas prices soaring to record highs, up about 50 percent on Wednesday (2/3/2022). The price of Dutch TTF gas, which is the European reference, for example, reached 194,715 euros (Rp 2.8 million) per megawatt-hour in morning transactions. British gas prices also jumped as high as 463.84 pence (approximately IDR 37,174.1 pound = 240 pence) per term, close to the record 470.83 pence (approximately IDR 37,751) hit in December 2021.
                    <br> <br>
                    With the war converging with other disruptions — supply-chain strains, inflation and the pandemic — it is now posing “a looming threat to our global food supply,” Daniel Aminetzah, leader of McKinsey’s Chemicals and Agriculture Practices, and Nicolas Denis, a partner at the management consulting firm, said in the company’s latest podcast Wednesday. The Ukraine–Russia region is seen as one of a small handful of global “breadbaskets” (or major food producers) and plays a vital role not only as an exporter of primary staples like wheat, but also as one of the major suppliers of fertilizer worldwide. “There are six breadbaskets that together supply roughly 60 to 70% of global agricultural commodities. The Ukraine–Russia region is responsible for roughly 30% of global exports of wheat and 65% of sunflower, in a context where those markets are increasingly tight and interconnected—so a slight disruption in supply creates some impact on price,” Denis noted.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Russia vs Ukraine war also made oil prices skyrocket on Wednesday (2/3/2022) because Russia is also one of the world's largest crude oil producers. European benchmark Brent North Sea earlier soared to 113.02 US dollars (Rp 2.17 million) per barrel, its highest level since 2014. New York-traded WTI peaked at 111.50 US dollars (Rp 2.14 million), levels last reached in 2013. Sellers will await the outcome of a meeting of OPEC and other major producers, including Russia, on Wednesday local time. The meeting will discuss whether to increase production to curb rising prices, which also boost inflation. The impact of the Russia vs Ukraine War also triggered sharp changes in global stock markets over the past week.

           <h4>SEVERODONETSK DEFENDS AMID ONSLAUGHT OF SHOOTING</h4>
           <div class="newsImage">
               <p>
                Ukrainian soldiers in Severodonetsk, the eastern city under continuous Russian bombardment, are holding their positions despite relentless shelling, and troops are “doing their utmost to defend the city,” its mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, said Tuesday. The situation remains “difficult,” he said, and “the fighting is not fading.”
                <br> <br>
                He issued the update a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine has “every chance” of winning the battle for Severodonetsk, even though analysts and officials say Russia controls a significant part of the city. At the same time, Moscow is preparing to seize Zaporizhzhia, a major southeastern city that would give Russian troops better access to the heart of the country, Zelensky warned.
                <br> <br>
                Aerial photographs from across eastern Ukraine revealed the destructive path Russia’s invasion has cut through that part of the country, where fighting has been focused for several weeks. The satellite images show fields full of artillery craters, city blocks reduced to rubble and a 130-foot bomb scar.

           <h4>RUSSIAN PRESIDENT LOSES 1 SOLDIER EVERY 5 MINUTES</h4>
           <div class="newsImage">
               <p>
                   One Russian soldier is dying “every five minutes”, a military official has claimed as Ukraine struck Russian forces in the south at least four times over the past 24 hours.
                   <br> <br>
                   In a Facebook video, Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration, said: “Every five minutes a Russian soldier dies in Ukraine.”
                   <br> <br>
                   Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces were successfully holding out against the assault in Sievierodonetsk, the general staff said on Wednesday, while Russian troops were bringing in new resources towards Donbas in an intense battle for control of the eastern region.
                   <br> <br>
                   The Kremlin has announced control over 97 per cent of Luhansk - one of the two provinces that form Donbas.
                   <br> <br>
                   Military analysts and Ukrainian officials have also said that Russia’s forces now occupy half of the other province Donetsk.
                   <br> <br>
                   However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video statement: “The absolutely heroic defence of Donbas is ongoing,” while Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk, and Popasna, remain the most difficult places.

           <h4>RUSSIA PROMISES TO SCALE DOWN OPERATIONS NEAR KYIV AND NORTH UKRAINE</h4>
           <div class="newsImage">
               <p>
                    Russia's promise to scale down military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine does not represent a ceasefire, Moscow's lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine said on Tuesday. "This is not a ceasefire but this is our aspiration, gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts," Reuters quoted Vladimir Medinsky as saying in an interview with the TASS news agency, referring to the promise to scale down operations near the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv.

            Tensions in Russia-Ukraine relations have been going on since 2014. At that time, the Ukrainian people voted for a more independent ouster of the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Pro-EU demonstrations occurred due to the rejection of Viktor's policy of preferring trade relations with Russia. The ouster of Viktor caused a conflict in the Ukrainian government until it was divided into two groups, pro-European Union and pro-Russia. Pro-Russians come from Crimean society as well as politicians.<br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, Russia's interest in resolving Ukraine's internal conflict has become an attempt to exploit Russia to gain territory in Crimea. The strategic location of Crimea seems to have been used by Russia to strengthen its influence in the Eastern and Central European regions.<br>
            <br>
            In March 2014, Yanukovych, a pro-Russian leader, was ousted from power; then, Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula.<br>
            A month later, pro-Russian separatists began seizing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. The ongoing fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people.

            Ultimately, Russia took over Crimea in March 2014 and broke away from Ukraine. Then, in April 2014, the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist movements declared independence.<br> 
            <br>
            In 2021 in April and November, Russia sent troops to Ukraine's borders because Russia wanted to ask for guarantees from Western countries that Ukraine would not become a member of NATO. Russia is concerned that Ukraine's entry into NATO will threaten its territory. NATO has the potential to build weapons installations in any part of Ukraine, so it has the potential to attack Russia.<br>
            In December 2021, the United States banned Russia from attacking Ukraine.<br>
